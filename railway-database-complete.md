Local Development:
├── Frontend (Next.js) → localhost:3000
├── Backend (Laravel) → localhost:8000  
└── Database (MySQL) → Railway Cloud ☁️

Production Ready:
├── Frontend → Render (when ready)
├── Backend → Render (when ready)
└── Database → Railway ☁️ (DONE!)
```

### **🚀 Ready to Use:**

Your Laravel application is now connected to Railway's cloud database:

```bash
# Start your backend
cd backend && php artisan serve

# Start your frontend  
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Your app now uses Railway database for all data!
```

### **📊 Database Connection Details:**
